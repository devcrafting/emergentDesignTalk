                        <p>The simplest solution : a <b>view</b> with a <b>view model</b> that gives available payment mode <b>AND</b> a <b>different model</b> registrering payment (emit an <b>event</b>)</p>

                            <li>no matter where data is stored, start with a Repository in memory implementation</li>
                            <li>no dependency on any model designed upfront, even the previous one (in feature 1)</li>
                            <li>no matter where this feature is deployed, dependencies does not exist, you could split later in components to deploy separaterly</li>
                            <li>your model could use <b>Event Sourcing</b> with events like "payment registered"</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>BONUS</b> : you just have done <b>CQRS (Command Query Responsability Segregation)</b></p>

                        <p>That's right ! The simplest solution : an event handler that handles the event payment registered (Feature 2) to update the view model of Feature 1</p>
                        <p><b>BONUS</b> : you just have done <b>DDD (Domain Driven Design)</b> with some Bounded Context defined, one for the toll gate payment system, one for the toll supervision</p>

                        <h3>And so on...</h3>
                        <p>Keep things isolated and simple, but refactor as you go to <b>make emerge some simple concepts</b> that will <b>allow you to keep options for later</b>...like perhaps a common Repository, an Event Publisher...</p>
