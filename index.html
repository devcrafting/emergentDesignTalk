					<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
					<p>There is no silver bullets</p>
					<p>That's not a judgement of what you do, just an option</p>
					<p>Your "confort zone" will be heckled</p>
					<p>We will discover some "hype" patterns like CQRS, DDD, EventSourcing...that's the how, but we will start with why</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Quick survey...</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						Do you have a design phase before development?
					</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Yes, it takes up to 20% (or even more) of dev effort!</li>
						<li>Yes, just to sketch some ideas and make some choices</li>
						<li>No, let's design emerge</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						Do you use a full stack framework upfront?
					</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Yes, it is the backbone of my architecture</li>
						<li>Yes, but just as an entry point</li>
						<li>No, prefer simple solution first</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						Why would you use a framework?
					</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>It makes simple lots of generic and powerful features</li>
						<li>It gives me a starting point and some guidance</li>
						<li>Avoid it, prefer libraries (if needed!)</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						When do you choose which tool you will use to store data?
					</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>It is already chosen before project starts (standard &amp; norms!)</li>
						<li>As soon as possible (design phase...), my database model is important</li>
						<li>Later, it is an implementation detail, will potentially choose several data stores</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						When do you decide which infrastructure you will use?
					</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>It is already chosen before project starts (standard &amp; norms!)</li>
						<li>You forecast usage of your applications with formulas</li>
						<li>Will see, make your application horizontally scalable</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						Do you develop with TDD (test first!) practice every day?
					</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>No, it's a waste of time!</li>
						<li>More or less, I try to test some classes</li>
						<li>Yes, all of my new code is created writing a test before</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						Results:)
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Majority of 1: you are very far from emergent design, let's discover</li>
						<li>Majority of 2: you are on the way!</li>
						<li>Majority of 3: you are ready for emergent design</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Emergent design</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why? Avoid early choices</h3>
					<p class="fragment">Early choices are predictions, but we are really bad at predictions!</p>
					<p class="fragment">Keep options to decide later</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>How?</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Avoid too much dependencies</h3>
					<p class="fragment">Your code will be simpler: <b>KISS! (Keep It Simple Stupid)</b></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Avoid lots of generic components</h3>
					<p class="fragment">You will perhaps not use them: <b>YAGNI! (You Aren't Gonna Need It)</b></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Avoid components requiring lots of configuration</h3>
					<p class="fragment">You can probably do the same with few lines of code</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Make small components with few dependencies</h3>
					<p class="fragment">Basically what we call hexagonal (or also clean, onion...) architecture</p>
					<p class="fragment">Or also micro-services architecture (buzz word these days!)...</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Prefer simple basic code<br/>OVER<br/>lots of bricks composed through huge configuration</h3>
					<p class="fragment">That's what we call "simplicity"</p>
					<p class="fragment">Emergent design &amp; simplicity leverage each other</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>When? At the "last responsible moment"!</h3>
					<p class="fragment">Ie. when you really need to take a decision</p>
					<p class="fragment">For demo, you can afford some temporary solutions for example...</p>
                    <p class="fragment note">Note: there are some controversial discussions on its meaning: <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Last+Responsible+Moment+reconsidered">Alistair Cockburn</a> (<a href="http://www.les-traducteurs-agiles.org/lean/2016/09/28/le-dernier-moment-responsable-reconsidere.html">fr</a>)</p>

					<h2>An example of simplicity with emergent design</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Context</h3>
					<p>You know twitter? Let's try to implement some sort of Twitter app...</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Registered users publish messages</li>
						<li>Users follow other users</li>
						<li>Users receive followers messages on their timeline</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Great! Like for any other application (silver bullet?!):</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Choose your preferred database engine and frameworks</li>
							<li class="fragment">Start to design my static model (UML classes, Merise entities, DB tables...)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Generate SQL database structure</li>
							<li class="fragment">Embed all of this in XXX framework...</li>
						</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>That is NOT simplicity! This is ACCIDENTAL COMPLEXITY!</h3>
					<p class="fragment">For example, why would you systematically do CRUD in first place?</p>
					<p class="fragment">Probably, users do not need CRUD!</p>
					<p class="fragment">Focus on ESSENTIAL complexity: start with features/user stories</p>
					<p class="fragment">Describe them with a test, then develop the simplest solution without any implementation details. You will take care
						of that later.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Feature 1: display last tweets of user timeline</h3>
					<p class="fragment">Your goal: focus on which data to display, not from where/how to retrieve data
					<p class="fragment">A simple solution: a <b>view</b> with a <b>read model</b> representing exactly what you want in this view</p>
					<img src="imgs/CQRS-Read.png" alt="CQRS Read side schema with UI, ReadModel as a DTO and its Repository" class="fragment"/>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Easy to do with TDD + options</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">no matter where data is stored, a simple Repository implementation will do the job when necessary, start with in-memory implementation</li>
						<li class="fragment">no dependency on any model designed upfront</li>
						<li class="fragment">as a side effect, caching will be really easy to implement with a so simple Repository</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Feature 2: tweet a message</h3>
					<p class="fragment">Your goal: enforce rules around tweeting a message (max nb chars...)
					<p class="fragment">A simple solution: a <b>Domain Model or Aggregate</b> (Message for ex) that (1) handles some <b>Commands</b> (input), (2) enforces rules and (3) raises some <b>Events</b> to represent what happened in the system</p>
					<img src="imgs/CQRS-Write.png" alt="CQRS Write side schema with UI, Command, Domain Model and Events" class="fragment" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Easy to do with TDD + keep options</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">no matter where data is stored, start with an in-memory implementation of Repository</li>
						<li class="fragment">no dependency on any model designed upfront, not even the previous one (in feature 1)</li>
						<li class="fragment">no matter where this feature is deployed, since there are no dependencies, you could split later in components to deploy separately</li>
						<li class="fragment">you could use <b>Event Sourcing</b> (only an option!): store events history instead of current state</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="fragment"><b>NB</b>: you just have done a bit of <b>CQRS (Command/Query Responsability Segregation)</b></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Wait! Feature 2 have an impact on Feature 1...but we do not have a common model</h3>
					<p class="fragment">That's right! The simplest solution: an event handler that handles MessageTweeted events (Feature 2) to update the timeline read model (Feature 1)</p>
					<img src="imgs/CQRS-Denorm.png" alt="Process that transform events into read model" class="fragment" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Feature 3: subscribe to other users</h3>
					<p class="fragment">Avoid to overload existing object (like User for ex) when no obvious relation with existing function (take care of "lack of cohesion")</p>
					<p class="fragment">A simple solution: create a <b>new Aggregate</b> that will take care of its own rules (Subscription for ex)</p>
					<p class="fragment"><b>NB</b>: you just have done a bit of <b>DDD (Domain Driven Design)</b> with two Bounded Contexts defined, one for Messaging, one for Subscription</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>And so on...</h3>
					<p>Keep things isolated and simple, but refactor as you go to <b>make emerge some simple concepts</b> that will <b>allow you to keep options for later</b></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Two good advices I like from DDD strategic patterns</h3>
					<p class="fragment">Avoid big ball of mud models (that seems to model reality), <b>learn to separate things</b> in Aggregates and Bounded Contexts</p>
					<p class="fragment">Avoid to systematically implement transactional consistency, <b>learn more about eventual consistency</b></p>
					<p class="fragment">No matter which solution you choose, it will help you use emergent design</p>

					<h2>Some tips...</h2>
					<h3 class="fragment">...on the road to software craftsmanship!</h3>
					<p class="fragment">That's another subject, but somewhat related</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Avoid some projects...</h3>
					<img src="imgs/avoid some projects.png" alt="someone raising hand behind a pile of documents and asking for help" />
					<p>...where requirements have been specified at a very detailed level, with lots of implementation details, which are probably not what users will need at the end.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Practice your coding skills</h3>
					<img src="imgs/practice.png" alt="happy guy in front of his computer (practicing its coding skills ;))" />
					<p>With some katas, go to coding dojos...</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Open your mind</h3>
					<img src="imgs/openminded.png" alt="opened skull to represent an open minded person" />
					<p>Participate to communities events, conferences, read blogs...</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Go out of your comfort zone</h3>
					<img src="imgs/comfortzone.png" alt="magic happens out of your confort zone" />
					<p>Do not rely on your skills, explore other technologies/ways of doing things...</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Embrace the culture of software craftsmanship!</h3>
					<img src="imgs/softwarecraftsmanship.png" alt="someone crafting a real thing with its hands" />
					<p>Read more on this subject...it is a mindset, not a certification or some other marketing thing!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Be careful to avoid classic methodology with emergent design!</h3>
					<p>Else you could end up with a big bull of mud, because of no refactoring, no code review, no pair programming, quick and dirty falacies...</p>
					<p>THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT THE SAME AS EMERGENT DESIGN!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>If you want to try by yourself: <a href="https://github.com/devlyon/mixter">https://github.com/devlyon/mixter</a></h3>
					<p>A step by step discovery of CQRS and EventSourcing concepts through code (sort of Koans)</p>
					<p>Available in C#, Java, Javascript and PHP</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Try <a href=http://fr.slideshare.net/ziobrando/event-storming-recipes>EventStorming</a> as a complementary workshop</h3>
					<p>Design starting with events, then find commands, then identify aggregates and discover contexts</p>
					<p>Really great tool to discover your domain and force you to avoid upfront data model</p>
